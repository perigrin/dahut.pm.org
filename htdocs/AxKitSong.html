<h1><a name="The AxKit Has Been Drinking">The AxKit Has Been Drinking</a></h1>
<p>(to the tune of Tom Waits' _The Piano Has Been Drinking_)</p>
<pre class="verbatim">The AxKit has been drinking
My mod_perl is asleep
And the segfaults went back to New York
XSP has to make a leak
And the config needs a haircut
And the DOM tree looks like it might break
Cause TLH's out of cigarettes
And have_lib is on the make
And my AxKit has been drinking
My AxKit has been drinking

And the ASPs are all freezing
And the CGI's blind in one eye
And you can't template the other
And Blueberry's got encoding aide
And strings are just so '90s
And my AxKit has been drinking
My AxKit has been drinking

Cause XML's like a sumo wrestler
Pointy brackets french roast
And XSL's cool for widgets
With the params of a form post
Cause my AxKit has been drinking
My AxKit has been drinking

And you can't find your baudster
With a comment counter
And he XPathes you and your friends
And pages just can't get served
Without him

And the office box is drooling
And the benchmarks are on fire
And schemata are pluraling
And the transforms have recursed
And my AxKit has been drinking
My AxKit has been drinking
My AxKit has been drinking
Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me.</pre>
